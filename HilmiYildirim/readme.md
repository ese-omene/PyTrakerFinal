# Feature: NoteBoard
_*by Hilmi Yildirim*_
  
### Description

The users will have a board to take notes similar to sticky notes on Windows. 
They will be able to create, update, delete notes on the board to keep the additional information. 
As the users complete their tasks on the website and track their works,
